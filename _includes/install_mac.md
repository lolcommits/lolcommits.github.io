You'll need ImageMagick installed. Homebrew makes this easy. Simply do:

    brew install imagemagick

Then simply do:

    [sudo] gem install lolcommits

<small>If you're using RVM (or rbenv), you can/should probably omit the sudo, but the default MacOSX Ruby install is dumb and requires it.<small>
